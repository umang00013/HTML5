        Creating Links in HTML </h1>
        <p>A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another.
             Links allow users to move seamlessly from one page to another, on any server anywhere in the world.</p>
             
        <p>A link has two ends, called anchors. The link starts at the source anchor and points to
             the destination anchor, which may be any web resource, for example, an image, an audio
              or video clip, a PDF file, an HTML document or an element within the document itself, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="my SQL">My SQL</h3>
<p>
    MySQL (/ˌmaɪˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/)[5] is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).[5][6]
    Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,[7] and "SQL",
    the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more 
    data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data.
    SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database,
    as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an
    RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's
    storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity
    and creation of backups.

<h3 id="or">Oracle</h3>
<p>Oracle is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Austin,
    Texas. The company was formerly headquartered in Redwood Shores, California, until December

    technology, cloud engineered systems, and enterprise software products—particularly its
    own brands of database management systems. In 2020, Oracle was the second-largest software
    company in the world by revenue and market capitalization.</p>
